# Hexapod

Hexapod is a type of robot that has six legs and is of great interest due to certain characteristics such as great stability. The project will focus on this particular type of robot.
The main task of the project is to construct a robot with the obtained guidelines, in the Copellia robotics software package. The goal is to complete the project task within the given guidelines and to study the new program environment. In the program, it is possible to add a code that would enable movement inside the simulation. That still remains to be done.
